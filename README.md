# ch-grossmeister-fastapi

FastAPI test, chess API written in Python.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Start API
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Endpoints
http://localhost:8000/game/5?q=gm_game

# Swagger DOCS
http://localhost:8000/docs

```

## Why?

Why not? Python rules!

...I'd like to integrate different kind of API's in my new API gateway I'm building right now.

So this is a perfect task, also for benchmarks:

NodeJS vs Python
NextJS vs Python
Everyone vs Python ^^
